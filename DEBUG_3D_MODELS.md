# üîç 3D MODEL DEBUG ANALYSIS

## PROBLEM SUMMARY
Animals in showcase look like "ships" instead of actual animals. 7/10 models load but contain wrong geometry.

## FINDINGS
- GLB files are valid (181KB, proper glTF format)
- Files contain "Bello_Body_Organic" meshes
- Problem: Primitive/placeholder geometry instead of animal shapes
- Hyper3D/Meshy AI pipeline not connected to actual model generation

## ROOT CAUSE
The procedural generation creates basic geometric shapes (spheres, cylinders) that get assembled into ship-like forms rather than anatomically correct animals.

## IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED
1. Replace procedural fallback with actual animal-shaped geometry
2. Activate Meshy AI/Hyper3D for realistic generation
3. Test with ONE perfect dog model first

## FILES TO CHECK
- `js/hyper3d-animals.js` - Contains basic sphere/cylinder assembly
- `assets/models/animals/bello/bello_medium.glb` - Primitive geometry
- Blender MCP integration not generating realistic models

**STATUS: CRITICAL - NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION**
