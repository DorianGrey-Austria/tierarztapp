# 🎯 VETSCAN PRO ROADMAP - Updated 27.08.2025

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE (CURRENT)
**Problem**: 3D Animals look like ships/primitives, not realistic animals
- ✅ GLB files load correctly (7/10 loaded)  
- ❌ Content is primitive geometry, not animal shapes
- ❌ Hyper3D/Meshy AI pipeline not active
- ❌ Blender MCP generating basic shapes only

## 📍 CURRENT STATUS
- **Version 9.0**: Deployed, basic showcase works
- **Version 10.0**: Code ready, but 3D generation broken
- **Infrastructure**: ahujasid/blender-mcp + Meshy AI + Hunyuan3D installed but not functional

---

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### 🔥 **Phase 1: Fix 3D Generation (URGENT - 1 hour)**
1. **Debug current GLB content**
   - Analyze why animals look like ships
   - Check Blender export pipeline
   - Validate procedural generation

2. **Activate realistic generation**
   - Test ahujasid/blender-mcp with proper prompts
   - Enable Meshy AI fallback
   - Generate ONE perfect dog model as proof-of-concept

3. **Replace broken models**
   - Replace primitive GLBs with realistic animals
   - Test in showcase immediately

## 🚀 NEXT PHASES

### **Phase 2: Scale Realistic Animals (2 hours)**
- Generate all 10 animals with proper anatomy
- Medical visualization modes (X-ray, skeleton, etc.)
- Performance optimization (<1MB per model)

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Features (3 hours)**  
- Interactive medical education
- Animation cycles (idle, walk)
- AR.js integration for mobile

### **Phase 4: Professional Polish (4 hours)**
- Advanced lighting and materials
- Sound effects per animal
- Achievement system
- Multi-language support
